# Create a deep learning model using LSTM neural network to predict new cases (cases_new) in Malaysia using the past 30 days of number of cases.

## Project Description
The year 2020 was a catastrophic year for humanity. Pneumonia of unknown aetiology was first reported in December 2019., since then, COVID-19 spread to
the whole world and became a global pandemic. More than 200 countries were affected due to pandemic and many countries were trying to save precious lives
of their people by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, social distances, event postponements and lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. However, due
to lackadaisical attitude, efforts attempted by the governments were jeopardised, thus, predisposing to the wide spread of virus and lost of lives. 

This project uses Deep learning concept in detection of Various Deadly diseases. It can detect lung cancer, covid-19, tuberculosis and pneumonia. LSTM neural network will be used to predict new cases (cases_new) in Malaysia using the past 30 days of number of cases.

## The installation and how to run the project

2) Again click on download icon
3) Click on download zip
4) Now your Zip will be downloaded , unzip and use it.

Get raw code

If you don't want the whole repository, or want to use only one or two files ,

1) Go to that file
2) Click on Raw and you will see the page with raw code ,
3) At this point you can download that page, or you can also copy the code.
4) To download the page simply run wget <pageUrl> 

### Steps for running the project 
Here are the steps to compile and run a GitHub project:

1) Clone the repository: Use the "git clone" command in a terminal/command prompt to download the project files to your local machine.
2) Navigate to the project directory: Use the "cd" command to navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
3) Install dependencies: If the project requires any external libraries, install them using the package manager specified in the project's documentation (e.g., pip, npm, etc.).
4) Compile the project: Depending on the language and framework used, compile the project using a build tool (e.g., make, gradle, etc.) or by executing a script provided in the project files.
5) Run the project: Execute the compiled binary or run the script to launch the project.
